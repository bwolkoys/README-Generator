## Description
Having a quality README is important as a developer. It’s where employers look to evaluate skills and professionalism. README files also contain information about the repo including resources, user story and acceptance criteria. README’s can take a while to create, so I’ve created this README Generator to make it easier and quicker to  create quality README files.
